# Manual Logistic Regression and mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent

### Overview

This project demonstrates the process of building a logistic regression model without relying on machine learning libraries for the core algorithm. 
The steps include data preprocessing, model implementation using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and evaluation of model performance.

### Conclusion

My understand of logistic regression and mini-Batch stochastic gradient descent are showcased here.
